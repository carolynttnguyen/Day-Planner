  Every student, or working person should make it a habit to stay organized. I learned at late age, how important it is to plan ahead of times, and with today's technological advances, you don't even need a planner. There are numerous appilcations online you can use as planner, to schdeule you day in advance. With the that being said, I created a Daily Hourly PLanner using  Application Programming interfaces, composed of dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and powered by Javascript.</p>

  In my source code you will find,  a few notes through each file to help others get a grasp of what the code is meant for, along with a clean and polished user interface. I made the page responsive as well, therefore leaving it more accesible. For my webpage design, I wanted to give it a little bit of a vibrant touches, so I linked Bootstrap to help me with the layout. In order to get the quiz generated, I create a series of functions via Javascript to get a dynamic interface.

  Some criterias that I considered -
```
 A Daily planner to create a schedule
Current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
Timeblocks for standard business hours
Timeblocks are color coated to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
User can input data or event into each time block
```

## Installation
For the whole source code, you will want to link, a HTML, CSS, and JS file together. JS can be linked in the body of your HTMl.
For my code editor, I use [visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which can be installed from their website. A quick tip- have you HTMl opened in the browers, so you can refresh any time to see if any changes have been made, or if the functions are working properly. In additon, if you would like a more complex or decorative layout I reccomend using Bootstrap to aid with the process. It will save you a lot of time.

## Concepts Used For This Project
* Capturing information entered by user using click events, and storing the gathered values in `localStorage`.
* Communicating with [Moment.js] to display current date and compare to current time. 
* Communicating with [fontawesome] to use a cute save button icon.
